              <p>The Citizens Foundation is a nonprofit that supposrts the eduation of underprivileged children in Pakistan. Each year, they host one big fundraiser in Austin, and we usually accumulate over $200k each year. My role these past few years has been to raise dues and collect payments. I have been emailing friends and family, and donating lots of my own money. This past summer, I actually got to visit Pakistan, and I got to see the schools that were being made and met the children that were able to go to school because of us.</p>

            <p>Throughout my life, I have been priviledged enough to have tutoring by myside whenever I need it. I took difficult courses, but there was always someone there to help me when I needed it. When I realized this, I wanted to give back. I became a tutorer at The Learning Room to provide free tutoring to any student who needs it. I taught a wide variety of subjects, ranging from AP Chemistry to Spanish I. Participating in this has brought me lots of fulfillment.</p>

          <p>As a member of FLASH, we were responsible for supporting out philanthropy, Twin City Mission, which is based out in Bryan. They have provided over 28k meals and over 16k nights of shelter. During FLASH, I was part of the fundraising committee, so I helped raise money and awareness for TCM. I did this through a 5k, where we were able to raise over $5k. During my sophomore year, I would visit the retail shop every other Saturday to help organize and move things around.</p>

        <p>This semester in Aggie Originals, we were able to get our own philanthropy that we could support. Because we have a lot of guys who struggle with sleeping the right amount, we decided to support Sleep in Heavenly Peace. They help build beds for people that can't afford them. So far, we have raised over $500 for them, and within a few weeks, we will be offering our labor.</p>

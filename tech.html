            <h2>Company Queue</h2>
            <p>Students come to the Texas A&M Career Fair with limited time, as they have to come between classes. It is unfortunate when students have to wait in long lines to talk to a single company. I am in the process of creating a system that will have students join a queue, and text them whenever the recruiters have space.</p>

            <h2>Company Selection</h2>
            <p>The Career Fair chairs spend hours deciding on which companies will come to the career fair, which is based upon a rubric. I automated this process using python, javascript, html, and css, so that I can advise them on which companies should come. I also organize the data neatly based off majors.</p>

            <h2>Backpack Check-In/Out</h2>
            <p>Having backpacks at the career fair is not only hazardous but also tiring. For that reason, we needed a system to store backpacks for when students attend. Using javascript, html, and css, I created a system that allows students to type in their UIN or swipe their student ID, and it will give them a location to put their backback. They can follow the same steps to retrieve it.</p>
